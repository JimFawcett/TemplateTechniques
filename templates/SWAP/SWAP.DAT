Demonstrating Template Function - swap(T& t1, T& t2)
====================================================

before swapping integers:
  x is 1
  y is 2
after swapping integers:
  x now is 2
  y now is 1

before swapping doubles:
  u is 1.5
  v is 2.5
after swapping doubles:
  u now is 2.5
  v now is 1.5

before swapping C strings:
  s = "a string"
  t = "more string"

after swapping C strings:
  s = "more string"
  t = "a string"
